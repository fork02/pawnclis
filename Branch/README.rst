Overview
========
Stability testing is a crucial phase in software development, ensuring that an application remains reliable under varying conditions. This document categorizes stability levels and provides guidelines for testing in different environments.

Stability Levels
================

Stable
------
A stable version is thoroughly tested and deemed ready for production use. It has undergone extensive debugging and performance evaluations.

**Characteristics:**

- Minimal to no critical bugs.
- Well-documented and supported.
- Recommended for end-users and production environments.

Testing Procedures:

1. Perform regression testing to ensure no new issues arise.
2. Conduct performance benchmarking.
3. Validate compatibility with dependent systems.

Testing
-------
A testing version is under active evaluation, potentially containing unresolved issues. It is suitable for testing new features and improvements.

**Characteristics:**

- Subject to changes and iterative improvements.
- Known issues may exist, but they are actively monitored.
- Suitable for controlled environments and beta testing.

Testing Procedures:

1. Execute unit tests and integration tests.
2. Perform user acceptance testing (UAT).
3. Monitor logs for inconsistencies or performance degradation.

Unstable
--------
An unstable version is experimental, potentially containing severe issues. It is not recommended for production use but is useful for early-stage development and testing.

**Characteristics:**

- Frequently updated with new features and fixes.
- High probability of bugs and crashes.
- Limited support and documentation.

Testing Procedures:

1. Conduct exploratory testing.
2. Perform stress and chaos testing.
3. Gather feedback from developers and testers.

Shell Scripting in Bash/Zsh
===========================
For automated stability testing, shell scripts are commonly employed. Below is a sample script that checks system uptime and logs stability status:

.. code-block:: sh

   #!/bin/bash
   LOG_FILE="stability.log"
   UPTIME_THRESHOLD=86400  # 24 hours in seconds

   echo "Checking system stability..." | tee -a $LOG_FILE

   UPTIME=$(cat /proc/uptime | awk '{print $1}')
   UPTIME=${UPTIME%.*}  # Convert to integer

   if [ "$UPTIME" -ge "$UPTIME_THRESHOLD" ]; then
       echo "System is stable (Uptime: $UPTIME seconds)." | tee -a $LOG_FILE
   else
       echo "System is unstable (Uptime: $UPTIME seconds)." | tee -a $LOG_FILE
   fi

Conclusion
==========
Stability testing ensures software robustness across different environments. Proper categorization and systematic testing help maintain reliability and improve user confidence. Automating stability checks using shell scripts can further streamline the process.
